# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even when data has been successfully fetched from a remote API.  The issue appears to be related to data processing or component lifecycle management, particularly with larger datasets.

## Bug Description

A React Native application uses a FlatList to display data fetched from a remote API.  In most cases, the data is rendered correctly.  However, after fetching a larger dataset, the FlatList sometimes renders as empty, even though the data is available in the component's state.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application.
3. Observe the FlatList rendering.  The issue is more likely to occur after multiple fetches of large datasets. 

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the way the FlatList handles the data update. Implementing keyExtractor and using a more efficient method to update the state to prevent unnecessary re-renders addresses the issue.
